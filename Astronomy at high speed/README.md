# Astronomy at High Speed

2021-06-26 update: I have now added files representing example
solutions. See AstronomyAtHighSpeedSolutions.ipynb which should just
display OK on the github page if you click it.

This folder contains the scripts and data files needed to complete the
exercises associated with the *Astronomy at High Speed* section of
ThaiPASS 2021.

You should have all of the files on your PC/laptop if you have cloned the
ThaiPASS 2021 repository. Once you have, navigate your way to the
*Astronomy at high speed* folder, and start Jupyter notebook to run
the notebook you will see there.
